# Covid19India-Visualisation
Tracking the early spread of Covid19 in India using the API from https://covid19india.org. Using d3.v2.js to visualise using edges and nodes to track the spread.

-----DISCLAIMER-----

This project was last updated in May 2020, since then the API has changed and the code may not work as initially intended. However, the files uploaded contain one of the last runs of the code and opening force.html will show a visualisation.

Simply run getdata.py. It will automatically pull data from the API and then launch the visualisation in your browser.
